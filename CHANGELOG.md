#### Default Parameters
- New stages automatically filled with sensible defaults
- Based on typical small compressor design (educational)
- All default values are valid and within recommended ranges
- Speeds up initial design process significantly

#### Design Rule Validation
- Automatic validation of design relationships
- Warnings for:
  - Hub/rotor diameter ratio
  - Stator/rotor blade count ratio
  - Tip clearance relative to blade height
  - Duct ID relative to rotor diameter
- Recommended ranges for all parameters

### Enhanced
- OpenFile and SaveFile methods now add files to recent list
- AddStage method applies default parameters automatically
- Render method shows progress indicators
- All file operations logged to error log
- Better error messages with log file references

### Technical Details

#### New Files
```
src/RecentFiles.py         - Recent files manager
src/ErrorLogger.py          - Error logging system  
src/DefaultParameters.py    - Defaults and validation

## [2.0.0] - 2026-02-04 - UI/UX Enhancements

### Added

#### Tooltips & Context-Sensitive Help
- Added comprehensive tooltips for all 30+ input parameters
- Tooltips include parameter description, purpose, and valid ranges
- Real-time validation feedback integrated into tooltips
- Color-coded validation states with explanatory messages

#### Undo/Redo System
- Full undo/redo functionality for all parameter changes
- Keyboard shortcuts: `Ctrl+Z` (undo) and `Ctrl+Y` (redo)
- Stack-based implementation with 50-state history
- Menu items in File menu with enabled/disabled states
- Automatic clearing on file load or preset application

#### Parameter Presets
- 5 pre-configured compressor designs:
  - Micro Turbine - Single Stage (80,000 RPM, 50mm)
  - RC Ducted Fan - High Speed (30,000 RPM, 80mm)
  - Industrial Compressor - Low Speed (15,000 RPM, 300mm)
  - High Pressure Ratio - Multi-Stage (50,000 RPM, aggressive)
  - Educational Example - Simple (10,000 RPM, beginner-friendly)
- New "Presets" menu with one-click loading
- Confirmation dialog with preset descriptions
- Loads all Stage, Rotor, and Stator parameters

#### 3D Assembly Viewer
- Interactive 3D viewer showing all stages together in correct spacing
- Color-coded rendering: Blue (rotors), Orange (stators)
- Multiple camera views: Front, Side, Top, Isometric
- Rotation animation with start/stop control
- Cross-section mode for cutaway views
- Mouse controls: Right-click rotate, Left-click zoom
- Accessible via `Tools > Assembly Viewer` menu

#### Drag-and-Drop Stage Reordering
- Click and drag stages to reorder in the list
- Stage data automatically moves with the item
- Uses Qt's native drag-drop functionality

#### Enhanced Validation Feedback
- Real-time visual feedback as user types
- Color-coded status: Green (valid), Yellow (incomplete), Red (invalid)
- Dynamic tooltips showing what's wrong and valid ranges
- No need to click away or press Enter to see validation

#### New Menus
- **Presets** menu with 5 preset configurations
- **Tools** menu with Assembly Viewer
- Updated **File** menu with Undo/Redo commands

### Changed
- Enhanced `CheckState()` method with better validation feedback
- Improved tooltip system with context-sensitive messages
